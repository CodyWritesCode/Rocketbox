# Rocketbox

Rocketbox is a hotkey-activated utility console for Windows designed to reduce the number of clicks required to perform tasks such as web searching, unit conversion, and more.

## Quick Start

Rocketbox runs in the background and waits for **Windows Key** + **~** to be pressed before appearing on the screen. It accepts a number of built-in commands, all of which can be viewed [here](COMMANDS.md).
